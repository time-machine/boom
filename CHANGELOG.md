# boom changes

## head

## 0.0.8
- Support for Ruby 1.9 (thanks [jimmycuadra](https://github.com/jimmycuadra)).

## 0.0.7
- Reverts item creation from stdin, since it broke regular item creation.

## 0.0.6
- Searching for an item that doesn't exist doesn't murder puppies anymore
  (thanks [jimmycuadra](https://github.com/jimmycuadra)).
- Output is a bit cleaner with a constrained `name` column.
- Adds items from stdin (thanks
  [MichaelXavier](https://github.com/MichaelXavier)).

## 0.0.5
- Item deletes are now scoped by list rather than GLOBAL DESTRUCTION! (thanks
  [natebean](https://github.com/natebean)).
- Command line options, like `boop --help` are translated into `boom help`. In
  the future we play around with options a bit more.

## 0.0.4
- Adds `boom help`. You know, for help.

## 0.0.3
- `boom edit` to edit your stuff in a friendly $EDITOR.
- Class-level accessors in List for ActiveRecordesque actions.

## 0.0.2
- Fix for list selection (thanks [bgkittrell](https://github.com/bgkittrell)).

## 0.0.1
- BOOM!

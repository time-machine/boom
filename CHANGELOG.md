# boom changes

## head
- Item deletes are now scoped by list rather than GLOBAL DESTRUCTION! (thanks
  [natebean](https://github.com/natebean)).
- Command line options, like `boop --help` are translated into `boom help`. In
  the future we play around with options a bit more.

## 0.0.4
- Adds `boom help`. You know, for help.

## 0.0.3
- `boom edit` to edit your stuff in a friendly $EDITOR.
- Class-level accessors in List for ActiveRecordesque actions.

## 0.0.2
- Fix for list selection (thanks [bgkittrell](https://github.com/bgkittrell)).

## 0.0.1
- BOOM!

## About

boom manages your text snippets. On the command line. I just blew your mind.

For more details about what boom is and how it works, check out
[boom's website](http://holman.github.com/boom). For full usage details
(including a complete list of commands), check out
[boom's wiki](https://github.com/holman/boom/wiki).

## Install

    gem install boom

## Contribute

I'd love to include your contribution, friend. Make sure your method are
[TomDoc](http://tomdoc.org)'d properly, that existing tests pass (`rake`), and
that any new functionality includes appropriate tests. Bonus points if you're
not updating the gemspec or bumping boom's version.

All good? Cool! Then
[send me a pull request](https://github.com/holman/boom/pull/new/master)!

## I love you

[Zach Holman](http://zachholman.com) made this. Ping me on Twitter -
[@holman](http://twitter.com/holman) - if you're having issues, want me to
merge in your pull request, or are using boom in a cool way. I'm kind of hoping
this is generic enough that people do some fun things with it. First one to use
`boom` to calculate their tax liability wins.

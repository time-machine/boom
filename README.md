# B O O M

See? Look, a tiny explosion: \*

## What's a boom?

boom lets you access text snippets over your command line. I am currently
aiming for exactly two use cases, but I'm almost positive there are thirteen
more. The targeted use cases are:

- **A pile of funny URLs.** When I make [clever animated
  gifs](http://github.com/holman/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/gifme) of my
  coworkers, I tend to lose the URL, which is a total bummer since I want to
  repeatedly repost these images well past their funny expiration date. boom
  lets me easily access the good stuff for years to come.
- **Commonly-used email replies.** Everyone's got those stock replies in their
  pocket for a few common use cases. Rather than keep some files strewn about
  with the responses, boom gives me them on my ever-present command line.

We store everything in one JSON file in your home directory: `~/.boom`. The
structure is simple, too. Each individual item is tossed on a `list`, and you
can have multiple lists.

## Show me the boom

** Delete a List **

    $ boom urls delete
    Youn sure you want to delete everything in "urls"? (y/n): y
    Boom! Deleted all your urls.
